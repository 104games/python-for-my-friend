# python-for-my-friend
python script that find if different txt files with lines of alfanumeric codes have the share codes 

LORE OF THE PROJECT WOOOOO:
    i have a friend whose dad works as a mechainc, but not for cars.
    for his job he needs to order pieces of a cathalog.
    each piece of the ctahalog has a code is made of different sub pieces.
    each sub piece has his code too.
    friend's dad struggles to see wich pieces have the same subpieces because he has to order them two times instead a single order of two!
    my friend told me the problem because he knows i like to solve problems with coding!
    so i made this code who can see if differente finished pieces (txt files) have the same sub pieces (lines of said txt).

LORE PROJECT PART 2 WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO:
    my friend told me that his dad also needed to know if there were exact coded that could choose in the files, 
    so i hadded another feature!! now you can choose between the first mode (the old one) and a new one, 
    that reads the codes he wants to compare in a txt file and then tells, how many and wich have them all, wich have only a few and wich have o


instructions mode 1:
    in this direcotry there are two example direcories and different example txt files, but you van create new direcories, remove the test ones and give whatever name you like.
    you will find two codes, the english one (...ENG.py) and the italian (...ITA.py) 
    run the one you like
    you will have to insert in wich direcory to look for txt files (blanc to look in the same direcotry as the script)
    if the direcory exist, it will return wich file has the same code as anothe one (multiple even)
    after it will print a summary with al codes and how many times they appear!

instructions mode 2:
    you will have to give the path that contains the codes you want to find in other files.
    you then give the direcotry where you store the other txt files
    it will the you the results

love yall <3 :)
