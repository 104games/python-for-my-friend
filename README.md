# python-for-my-friend
python script that find if different txt files with lines of alfanumeric codes have the share codes 

LORE OF THE PROJECT WOOOOO:
i have a friend whose dad works as a mechainc, but not for cars.
for his job he needs to order pieces of a cathalog.
each piece of the ctahalog has a code is made of different sub pieces.
each sub piece has his code too.
friend's dad struggles to see wich pieces have the same subpieces because he has to order them two times instead a single order of two!
my friend told me the problem because he knows i like to solve problems with coding!
so i made this code who can see if differente finished pieces (txt files) have the same sub pieces (lines of said txt).

instructions:
    in this direcotry there are two example direcories and different example txt files, but you van create new direcories, remove the test ones and give whatever name you like.
    you will find two codes, the english one (...ENG.py) and the italian (...ITA.py) 
    run the one you like
    you will have to insert in wich direcory to look for txt files (blanc to look in the same direcotry as the script)
    if the direcory exist, it will return wich file has the same code as anothe one (multiple even)
    after it will print a summary with al codes and how many times they appear!


love yall <3 :)
